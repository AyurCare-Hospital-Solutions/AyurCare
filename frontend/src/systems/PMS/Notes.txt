1. About useEffect()
    LINK: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-perform-crud-operations-using-react/
    The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
    Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
    useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
    useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

        *****In the useEffect Hook, let's send the GET Request.

        useEffect(() => {
        axios.get(`https://60fbca4591156a0017b4c8a7.mockapi.io/fakeData`)
            .then((response) => {
                setAPIData(response.data);
            })
        }, [])

        *****So, we are using axios.get to send the GET request to the API. Then, if the request is fulfilled, we are setting the response data in our APIData state.
